# Codify

This Chrome extension allows you to transform any region of text on a page
into a nice monospaced format by pressing `Alt+C` (`Opt+C` on Mac) or by pressing the
extension button.

Most importantly, all styles are done inline, so this can be used to format
code in emails using your favorite webmail client.
